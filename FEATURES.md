# WebElements - Local Development Guide

## üöÄ Features Added

### 1. Branding Update
- Changed all branding from "Elementor" to "WebElements"
- Updated logo from "E" to "W"
- Updated all CSS class names from `elementor-*` to `webeditor-*`

### 2. Fixed "Add Section" Button
The "Add Section" button in the top toolbar now works correctly. When clicked, it adds a new section with a column to your page.

### 3. Browser Preview Feature
Added a new preview button (external link icon) next to the existing preview button. This allows you to:
- Preview your page in a new browser tab
- See how your page looks without the editor interface
- Test your page in a clean environment
- Includes error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 4. App.js for Local Development
Created an `App.js` file that provides a simple entry point for local development. This file includes:
- Development server utilities
- Production build scripts
- Comprehensive documentation
- Quick start guide

## üéØ How to Use the New Features

### Adding Sections
1. Click the "Add Section" button in the top toolbar (center of the toolbar)
2. A new section with a column will be added to your page
3. You can then drag widgets from the left panel into the section

### Previewing in Browser
1. Add some content to your page using the Add Section button or by dragging widgets
2. Click the external link icon (üîó) in the top toolbar
3. This will save your current page state and open it in a new tab
4. The preview shows your page without the editor interface
5. Use the "Close Preview" button to return to the editor

### Running Locally with App.js
The project already has a working development setup, but you can also use the App.js file:

**Current Setup (Recommended):**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Alternative with App.js:**
```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build
npm start
```
